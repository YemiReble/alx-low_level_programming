# Project - Argc & Argv in C.

## C is fun.

### At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google.

## General Learning.
* How to use arguments passed to your program
* What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
* How to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

## Tools to use

* Editors: vi, vim, emacs.
* All file are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
* All files ends with a new line.
* This code use the Betty style. It can be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
* No more than 5 functions per file are used.
* The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function _putchar is included in the header file called main.h.
* You are allowed to use the standard library.
